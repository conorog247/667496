  <h3>Punta Cana</h3>
  <p>Punta Cana is a resort town in the easternmost region of the Dominican Republic. It is part of the Veron-Punta Cana municipal district, in the Higüey municipality of La Altagracia Province. Punta Cana is one of Latin America's most popular tourist destinations, with more visitors than any other country in the Carribean region. The area is known for its white sand beaches, blue turquoise waters, and balnearios which face both the Carribean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The weather is hot for most of the year, especially in late summer and autumn when the Northern Tropics receive their most direct sunlight.</p>

  <h3>Bonaire</h3>

  <h3>Aruba</h3>
  <p>Aruba is an island country in the mid-south of the Carribean Sea, about 29 kilometers north of the Venezuelan peninsula of Paraguana and 80 kilometers northwest of Curacao. Aruba is the happy home to constant sunshine and powdery-soft white-sand beaches. On Aruba you can find a wide selection of activities on land or at sea. Get on board a catamaran for a snorkel or sunset sail or take a plunge and discover Aruba's underwater world. Climb the 587 steps to the top of the Hooiberg, visit Aruba's natural wonders Natural Pool and Natural Bridge or explore National Park Arikok to get a chance to view a great variety of landscapes including caves, rough hills of volcanic lava formations, sand dunes and beaches.</p>

  <h3>Malaga</h3>
  <p>Malaga is the capital of the Province of Malaga on the Costa del Sol in Spain. Beyond its 16 sunny beaches, this Andalusian city on the shores of the Mediterranean has a fascinating cultural side. And the birthplace of Pablo Picasso has reinvented itself in recent year, inaugurating museums for all tastes. If you take the combination of sea and culture and add a lively atmosphere, plenty of tapas served in its bars, fashionable neighbourhoods like Soho, areas such as the port that have been transformed to offer a more modern image, and monuments with centuries of history, the result is an exciting city everyone would want to discover. Because if everyone says that Malaga is prettier than ever then it must be true. Malaga is a city full of historical spots such as the Alcazaba, one of the largest Moorish fortresses in Andalusia, or Gibralfaro Castle, which offers the best views over the city. At the foot of the castle there is a Roman theatre and an old town to stroll around.

  <h3>Paphos</h3>
  <p>Paphos is a coastal city in southwest Cyprus and the capital of the Paphos District. In classical antiquity, two locations were called Paphos: Old Paphos, today known as Kouklia, and New Paphos. It lies on the Mediterranean coast, and was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List for its ancient architecture, mosaics and ancient religious importance in 1980. The region is ideal for basking in the sunshine all year round, and experience the hospitality of its people wherever you go. Plunge into the sparkling warm waters of the Mediterranean in summer, or venture out on a splendid nature trail and observe fields blanketed in wildflowers in the spring; visit ancient and historical landmarks in autumn, and keep fit with a plethora of outdoor activities in winter. </p>

  <h3>Madeira</h3>
  <p>Madeira is one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal. It is an archipelago situated in the North Atlantic Ocean. It offers an all year round summer climate, as well as wonderful fauna and flora.  The island is surprisingly mountainous with peaks of 1,860 metres (over 6,100 feet high)! Fortunately, volcanic activity stopped about 6,500 years ago but it was precisely this activity that endowed the island with a fertile landscape, which favoured the ancient subtropical rainforest that covered most of the territory. Parts of this Laurel forest (Laurissilva) still remain, mainly on the northern slopes and have become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but the superb blooms for which the island has become famous may be found in abundance all year round.  The island produces bananas, sugarcane and Madeira Wine, but now derives much of its economic growth from tourism. The north remains mainly rural in nature whilst the south, especially in and around Funchal, has developed with the discerning traveller in mind.
