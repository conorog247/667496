  <h3>Curacao</h3>
  <p>Curacao is a Lesser Antilles island country in the southern Carribean Sea and is part of the Dutch Carribean region. It is about 65km north of the Venezulean coast.
    The beaches of Curacao dot the coastline one by one. From the idyllic Cas Abou to the laid-back, family atmosphere at Kokomo, Curacao has private coves that have all the space you need to get away from it all.
    Curacao has something for everyone, whether you're the outdoors type that would like to scale the highest peaks at Mt. Christoffel or you're a foodie that would like to take in the art and cafes of Pietermaai.</p>

  <h3>Kos</h3>
  <p>Kos is a Greek island that is part of the Dodecanese island chain in the southeastern Aegean Sea. It is the third largest island of the Dodecanses by area.
    Kos has a 5,000 year long history and has been influenced by many cultures, such as the Romans, the Venetians, the medival knights and the Ottomans. Thanks to the remains of all of these cultures, sightseeing is one of the best things to do in Kos. The most important of them is Asklepieion, one of the top holistic healing centres of the ancient world, which followed the medical guidelines of Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine.
    Kos is known as the cycling island as bicycling is a very popular means of transportation. There is a 13km long cycling road starting from Faros beach and ending at Psalidi beach.
    Kos has endless beaches with something for everyone.
